Had problems in the following steps in lab 5:
5a) part 4) step 1) e)  ;
5b) part 1) step 5) c)	;
5b) part 2) step 3) g)	;
5b) part2)step 4) c)
Will i be able to discuss them with you?


(I have all the steps i followed/ commands i wrote during that lab written down in my notepad and can show them to you if you need)
(i usually tend to give motd, hostname and no dns lookup together for router and switches, so these may not be given in the list)
(similiarly show vlan brief, show ip int brief may also not be given in the list of commands as i write them automatically instead of copy pasting them)
Details about each problem:

5a) part 4) step 1) e) ping to 192.168.10.11 g0/0/0 failed
but ping to 192.168.10.12 source g/0/0 Succeeded 

5b) part 1) step 5) c) where to write "no interface vlan" to remove vlan 10? (should it be written in config? any specific interface port? any specific vlan config?

5b) part 2) step 3) g) Can ping s3 and s4 from r1#, but couldnt ping r1 from s3# and s4#. why was this the case?

5b) part2)step 4) c) i could ping 192.168.1.11 from source g0/0/1.99
but couldn't ping it from source g0/0/1.10, source g0/0/1.20, and source lo0
