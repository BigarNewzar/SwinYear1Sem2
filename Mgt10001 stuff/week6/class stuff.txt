i think its normative method as employees have been carefully selected with regards to passion + music skills. Thus here we are regulating worker behaviour with shared organisation belief of passion and music skills being equally important.

for chef: feed forward can be in the form of checking whether ingredients and recipes are ok or not

concurrent can be in the form of tasting the food while cooking to see if the taste is ok or not and also checking other people's food (as the headchef) to see if they are doing properly or not

feedback can be in the form of asking customers whether food is ok or not and on things that can be done to improve it 


Thank you for the session! Hope you have a wonderful break!
And sorry for not being too much active today, collaborate had been going on and off and thus i couldnt actually see the video until the middle of the session and the voice kept cutting off.
