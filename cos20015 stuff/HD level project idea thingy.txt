Intro:
basic information and necessity of database in general
+2 types of databases availabe, 1 is mysql (relational database)
other is NoSQL (relational and not relational databse)

Mysql: (defn, what is basically is and where it commonly used (eg for structured data and.....tables) and for which company (if any),basic benefits and drawbacks)

NoSql: (defn, what is basically is and where it commonly used (eg for what type of data or table) and for which company (if any),basic benefits and drawbacks)

Compare the following points among both of them:
    data structures, normalisation aspect, retrieval (how easy is it to recombine information to find new knowledge in the data?).
	
	(say how it is maintianed in mysql, + code to back it up)
	(say how it is maintianed in nosql, + code to back it up)
	
	
	
    concurrency model/isolation levels.
	(say how it is maintianed in mysql, + code to back it up)
	(say how it is maintianed in nosql, + code to back it up)
	
	
    speed of access; updates (including inserts) and queries.
	(say how it is maintianed in mysql, + code to back it up)
	(say how it is maintianed in nosql, + code to back it up)
	
	
    database security (demonstrate how you implement safeguards, do not list security issues and safeguards from the internet).
	(say how it is maintianed in mysql, + code to back it up)
	(say how it is maintianed in nosql, + code to back it up)

Conclusion:
Overall, whether one should use Mysql or NOsql to store data depends on:
 a)what sort of data they are dealing with,
	.......(the other differences between mysql and nosql)
