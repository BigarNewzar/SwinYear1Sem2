WIll this be ok to do as a research project?

Theme: 
Use of Factory Pattern

question to ask: 
Is Factory Pattern better or worse for programs?//// using factory pattern as inheritance alternative adn speak in that lines....

intro: 
	Speaking about Factory Pattern in general + defn+ with its usuage in common programs
	(also will say the following near end of para:
	"i will say how to set it up and give visual and practical difference as scope of the writing")

Para 2: 	
	Setting up a small factory patterndesign in code + explaination of steps
	setting up same code witout using factory (ie via inheritance)
 
Body Paras: 

	Points i would focus on (given in 1 and 2): (by normal i mean by using inheritance and instantiate in main file (like activelogic if thought from custom game pov) method)

	1)Visual difference: ////say it as :       design or qualitative difference

		a)extra lines of code need to setup 
						+
		b)Client (ie activegamelogic) doesnt need to know what parameters are needed to make entities so ...encapsulation and info hidiing
						+
		c)only need to pass in type in the client part & no need to instantiate in there (encapsulation + cohesion + coupling)
						+
		d)no need high level of inheritance in setup so easy to add new stuff and centralise obj management


						

	2)Practical Difference:  /////say it as :       performance difference

		a)RunTime DIfference between the normal and factory pattern code for multiple object creation
							+
		b)Storage Usage when making multiple object creation in both ways
							+
		c)Memory Usage when making multiple...... (not sure how to do this part, is there a way to see this in VS after code has completed running?)
		//diagnostic info, Vs setting , system library

Conclusion: 
	Consider whether it is actually useful for general purpose codes or not 
	what sort of code would it benefit or harm
